# Wrap-up
  I am currently an engineer at CERN studying and improving the software ecosystem for continuous monitoring of critical technical services.
  I obtained my PhD at LIRMM studying "Agile engineering of software product lines for decision support applications in agriculture" in partnership with ITK.
  I did a Master's degree in Software and Web Architecture and Engineering at the University of Montpellier, where I also did my third year of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During my Masters, I had the opportunity to spend a semester as an exchange student at the University of Helsinki in Finland.
  I gained a wide range of experience in software development by working on projects in Canada, France and Indonesia. During my PhD, I also taught at the University of Montpellier for 3 years.
